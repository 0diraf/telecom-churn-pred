# ðŸ“žTelecom Company Customer Churn Prediction Model

In this project, I wanted to work with customer attrition data in the telecom industry. However, gaining access to such a dataset on real-world customer churn can be a very difficult task. Because of challenges like data privacy concerns, proprietary restrictions, and ethical considerations, companies often guard their customer data with utmost security, making access to genuine and extensive datasets a rarity.

However, one popular sample dataset that is used to study customer churn is [IBM's Telco Customer Churn sample dataset.](https://accelerator.ca.analytics.ibm.com/bi/?perspective=authoring&pathRef=.public_folders%2FIBM%2BAccelerator%2BCatalog%2FContent%2FDAT00148&id=i9710CF25EF75468D95FFFC7D57D45204&objRef=i9710CF25EF75468D95FFFC7D57D45204&action=run&format=HTML&cmPropStr=%7B%22id%22%3A%22i9710CF25EF75468D95FFFC7D57D45204%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22reportView%22%2C%22defaultName%22%3A%22DAT00148%22%2C%22permissions%22%3A%5B%22execute%22%2C%22read%22%2C%22traverse%22%5D%7D) This dataset is about different characteristics of customers of a fictional telecom company operating in Californa.

## âœ… Objectives

 The main objectives of this project are:

* Examine and pre-process the different datasets containing user characteristics
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover any underlying insights in the dataset
* Build a model that predicts whether or not a user will leave the telecom company's services

The final model achieves a 95% accuracy score on unseen test data.
